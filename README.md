# 🔢 Postfix Expression Evaluator – Stack Visualization

A web-based interactive application to **evaluate Postfix expressions** using a **stack**, with **step-by-step visualization** to help students understand how the algorithm works internally.

This project is especially useful for **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** learning and demonstrations.

## Features

- ✅ Supports **space-separated postfix expressions**
- ✅ Handles **multi-digit operands**
- ✅ Step-by-step evaluation using **Next** and **Previous** buttons
- ✅ Clear **stack visualization (tree-style)**
- ✅ Shows **current symbol** being processed
- ✅ Displays **final result** clearly
- ✅ Input validation for invalid postfix expressions
- ✅ Responsive and user-friendly UI

##  How It Works

- The user enters a **postfix expression** where each operand or operator is separated by a space.
- Each click on the **Next** button performs **one step** of the postfix evaluation algorithm:
  - Operands are pushed onto the stack.
  - Operators pop two operands, apply the operation, and push the result back.
- The **Previous** button allows navigating back to earlier steps.
- Once evaluation is complete, the **final result** is displayed.
